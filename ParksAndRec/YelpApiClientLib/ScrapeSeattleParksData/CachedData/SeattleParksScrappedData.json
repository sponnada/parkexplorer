Ernst, a Fremont resident, was instrumental in implementing Seattle's Olmsted parks plan.Built on a steep hillside, Ernst Park is comprised of a spiraling path of water-permeable concrete, bordered by artful garden-bed walls that park designer Lynn Thompson created to serve as seating. The path spirals down from N 35th St. to a small amphitheater, and continues down via stairway to N 34th St. The park provides wheelchair access to the community room of the Fremont Library (a Carnegie library) next door. The park also provides pedestrian connections between the library, commercial core, and residential areas. There is enough seating in this small park for 150 to 200 people. The sloped beds are landscaped with barberry and other sustainable native vegetation.",

The four block park has one lane of traffic and boasts improved landscaping, better lighting, and more open space. The continuous level pavement encourages pedestrians, cyclists, and automobiles to share the space.  Nationally recognized artist Sheila Klein created the art for the park. It is hoped that the art will be the catalyst for park activation. Klein's artwork, Souvenir, consists of four bronze artworks that are featured on each of the blocks that Bell Street Park occupies. Sheila Klein was inspired by her personal history as an artist living and working in Belltown during the 1980s. The art serves as a physical love letter to the neighborhood, and encourages those who live in and visit Belltown to find their own path.",

Enter the park through one of three arbors that were designed, fabricated and installed by University of Washington architecture students in the Howard S. Wright Design / Build Studio under the tutelage of instructor Steve Badanes.  Winding paths connect the many features of Bradner Gardens Park. Stroll past seven ornamental theme gardens of the Master Gardener border: butterfly & hummingbird, fragrance, sensory, shade, xeriscape, winter interest and northwest native. Watch the bees buzz the 61 p-patch plots. Learn the alphabet under the watchful eye of the baby scarecrow in the children's A to Z garden. Learn how to grow food crops in the Seattle Tilth and Urban Food demonstration gardens. Watch birds take shelter in the native plant habitat. See more than 50 varieties of ornamental street trees recommended for small spaces and under utility lines.  Play basketball on the renovated court that has one regulation hoop and one adjustable hoop. See the 33-foot-tall vintage (1916 to 1933) Aermotor windmill that circulates water from the seasonal pond to the dry streambed next to the children's play area. Discover art throughout the garden: scarecrows, decorated hose bibs and pillars, a Buster Simpson wind vane, and fish signs. Sit on the salmon bench carved from a maple log by Chris Vondrasek. Watch a basketball game from the mosaic bench decorated by Coyote Junior High students. Let your eyes wander from the garden weasel wind chime by Clair Colquitt to the trellis made from garden tools. Stroll across the foot bridge to sit in the shelter of the leaf-shaped pavilion built by the architecture students. Community volunteers worked with Barker Landscape Architects to design Bradner Gardens Park in cooperation with the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation. Friends of Bradner Gardens Park is a special collaboration of residents of the Mt. Baker Community and the following horticultural organizations: ",

In 1997, Sea Mar, a community organization located in South Park, was granted stewardship of the property by King County. In the years since Seattle Parks and Recreation assumed management of the park through a Surface Use Permit with King County. Students at nearby Concord school have participated in workshops learning about modern art and Cesar Chavez, and created a painting that is posted at the park.  Jesus Bautista Moroles, a nationally recognized stone sculptor, donated a sculpture titled \"Musical Steles,\" comprised of three musical basalt columns fabricated in the South Park neighborhood. A documentary titled \"Seasonal Soil...Singing Stones,\" made in 2003 by Jennifer Maas, tells the story of Cesar Chavez Park and South Park. The documentary has aired on the Seattle Channel and is shown as part of a permanent exhibit of Jesus Moroles' work at the Houston Museum of Art.",

The battle was short lived, however, largely because of the fire power of the gunship Decatur, moored in Elliott Bay. During freeway construction in 1964, several more cannonballs were unearthed below Harborview Hospital. City Hall park, in keeping with its military history, was used as a drill ground for troops during World War II. (Excerpted from Enjoying Seattle's Parks by Brandt Morgan.)",

This is one of five small parks in the area donated by the Denny-Blaine Land Company, a real estate development company. The parks are Minerva Fountain (commonly known as Denny-Blaine Lake Park), Stevens Park, Viretta Park, Children's Park (now Howell Park), and Whitman Place (now Denny-Blaine Park). The Denny-Blaine Land Company was operated by Elbert F. Blaine (1857-1942) and Charles L. Denny (1861-1919). Blaine was a member of the board of park commissioners from 1902 to 1908, an advocate of the Olmsted plan, and has been called \"the father of Seattle's Park System.\" Denny was a civic activist engaged in many business interests and a son of Seattle founder Arthur Armstrong Denny (1822-1899). The name Minerva Fountain is in honor of Minerva Stone Blaine (1861-1940), the wife of Elbert F. Blaine. The Denny-Blaine company built a shelter at Minerva Fountain for trolley riders, which also served as a realty office for the company. The name the park is now known by is derived from a sign on that structure stating the ultimate destination of many of the trolley riders, Denny-Blaine Park, which is on Lake Washington.",

The site is one of breathtaking majesty. Situated on Magnolia Bluff overlooking Puget Sound, Discovery Park offers spectacular view of both the Cascade and the Olympic Mountain ranges. The secluded site includes two miles of protected tidal beaches as well as open meadow lands, dramatic sea cliffs, forest groves, active sand dunes, thickets and streams. The role of Discovery Park is to provide an open space of quiet and tranquility away from the stress and activity of the city, a sanctuary for wildlife, as well as an outdoor classroom for people to learn about the natural world. Maintained in its semi-natural condition the park will continue to offer a biologically rich and diverse natural area for urban dwellers and an unmatched opportunity for environmental education. ",

    "About": "Dr. Blanche Lavizzo Park is a narrow park that connects S Jackson St. and E Yesler Way. Its many oak, poplar, and other shade trees give the park a sense of seclusion even though there are houses and apartments on its east and west sides. The park also features a large grassy area with picnic tables and grills, a picnic shelter with fireplace, a long shelter house, a bricked open area with benches, and a small amphitheater used for free summertime concerts and plays. Another part of the Seattle parks system named for Dr. Lavizzo is the children's water feature at nearby Edwin T. Pratt Park. The Dr. Blanch Lavizzo Water Play Area was built by the community in 1994-1995, using the Neighborhood Matching Fund to hire local African American artists. Designed with African motifs, the play area includes two water columns and three animal sculptures that spray water. On the site is a bronze plaque with an image of Dr. Lavizzo, text, and a poem by Alice Walker.",

Local Seattle artist Stuart Nakamura was chosen to create new art pieces for the renovated park. With the help of the community(children from the Denise Louie Education Center and seniors from Legacy House), Nakamura designed 3 different pieces to represent the different cultural elements in the neighborhood. The sculptures are a spinning top, I-Ching Coin and SepakTakraw Ball.",

The park landscaping is young, but will grow to provide natural play in groves of trees at the northeast corner of the park and at the Hubbard homestead site. The park also includes a main lawn surrounded by meadow planting, a half basketball court, a hydro-seeded \"wet meadow,\" and a gateway plaza at 112th Street and 5th Avenue. The \"wet meadow\" offers a final natural bio-filtration for runoff and contributes to the health of Thornton Creek. The park paths help define and provide accessible connections to the main spaces within the park. The diagonal spring runnel that runs the length of the park represents the 'blue streak' which was the name of the first park and ride lot that occurred on this site. The art, created by Laura Haddad and Tom Drugan, intends to re-invent the site's previous natural spring. The source stone is entitled \"Mnemonic Spring\" and the sculpture at 5th Ave. NE is entitled \"Cloud Chamber.\"",

Kubota was a horticultural pioneer when he began merging Japanese design techniques with North American materials in his display garden in 1927. The Gardens are a spectacular setting of hills and valleys, interlaced with streams, waterfalls, ponds, bridges, and rock out-croppings with a rich array of plant material. Learn more at www.kubotagarden.org.",

If you'd like to join Friends of Linden Orchard, please contact Prudence Kluckhohn at  pckluckhohn@comcast.net  for information about work parties and other events and activities. Friends of Linden Orchard raised $100,000 for a $100,000 matching grant through the Pro-Park Levy in 2001. The group contributes 400 hours throughout the year for the upkeep of the park",

The park includes many spectacular trees, including redwood, aspen, and dogwood. There is a birch grove and a wildflower meadow. Recent landscaping improvements emphasize low-maintenance and native plans. A new \"spring\" was created to honor the neighborhood's history of springs. Mineral Springs Park is home to one of Seattle's two disc golf courses. (The other is at Lakewood Park, SW 108th St. & 10th Ave. SW, in the King County Parks and Recreation system.) As a complement to that active game area and to the landscape, there is also an \"art walk.\" Artists Lynn Sullivan and Stacy Levy have created \"Cloud Stones\" especially for this park, a series of meditative stone sculptures intended to reflect the movement of clouds overhead. An information kiosk provides more details on the artworks as well as a map of the park.",

Featuring a 44-ft. wide cowboy hat and 22-ft. high boots, the Hat n' Boots opened the next year to a stampede of customers. In fact, for a time it was the biggest selling station in the state. Legend has it even Elvis dropped by when he was in town during the World's Fair in '62. But in the early 60's, a brand new interstate, I-5, started diverting traffic away from the station. By the late 80's it pretty much looked like trail's end for the Hat n' Boots. That's when some Georgetown residents saddled up to rescue the soul of their community. \"The Hat n' Boots is as important to Georgetown as the Golden Gate Bridge is to San Francisco,\" says Allan Phillips, former director of the Georgetown Community Council. \"If the Hat n' Boots were ever to be gone from Georgetown, it would be like losing our soul.\"",

Bear heads at the base of the pedestal spout streams of water into a pool. Tilikum Place itself (the name meaning \"welcome\" or \"greetings\" in Chinook jargon) is located at the juncture of the original land claims of Denny, Boren, and Bell. Excerpt from Enjoying Seattle's Parks by Brandt Morgan.",

    "About": "A multi-use community open space includes a performance area/plaza, rain gardens to improve stormwater quality, pedestrian pathways, lawn areas, basketball hoop, landscaped areas and other amenities.  The design is sensitive to the view of the historic building's south façade. The University Heights Elementary School served University District children from 1902 to 1989, when Seattle Public Schools closed the school. A year later it was open as a neighborhood center. The acquisition from Seattle School District and redevelopment of University Heights and its South Lot became a top community priority and identified in the University District Park Plan. University Heights Center and Seattle Parks and Recreation closed on their respective purchases of the historically landmarked building and open space in the summer of 2009.  The 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy Opportunity Fund provided development funding  for the park. The final design was the result of a collaborative partnership between SPR, SDOT, University Heights Community Center, other non-for-profit community organizations and the community. Through several community workshops, a strong community desire emerged to maximize the open space for multiple uses and to create a seamless design between the various properties. The design improvements include a multi-purpose plaza that functions for parking and to host festivals and events. The parking plaza flows into the park plaza which integrates scored panels for chalk art by adjacent school children and a basketball hoop and also functions as overflow gathering space for events.",

A deluxe play area, completed in 2004, includes a play structure specially designed for two- to five-year-olds, with a variety of slides. The wading pool was renovated then as well, and all elements are wheelchair accessible. Extensive landscaping surrounds the wading pool, and a crushed rock path around the playfield connects to the paths on the park's east end. The park's short, steep west border is a native plant garden. Picnic tables among the trees, benches, and sitting boulders provide plenty of places to sit and read, rest, or watch children play. ",

It's the perfect spot to take a break and admire the fountain, or watch shoppers as they visit the Westlake Mall and the surrounding retail stores. From here it's a quick trip by monorail to Seattle Center or a short walk to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum and many other attractions.",
