Ernst, a Fremont resident, was instrumental in implementing Seattle's Olmsted parks plan.Built on a steep hillside, Ernst Park is comprised of a spiraling path of water-permeable concrete, bordered by artful garden-bed walls that park designer Lynn Thompson created to serve as seating. The path spirals down from N 35th St. to a small amphitheater, and continues down via stairway to N 34th St. The park provides wheelchair access to the community room of the Fremont Library (a Carnegie library) next door. The park also provides pedestrian connections between the library, commercial core, and residential areas. There is enough seating in this small park for 150 to 200 people. The sloped beds are landscaped with barberry and other sustainable native vegetation.",

The widened path accommodates a lot of folks, and there's plenty of parking along Alki Ave. SW. There are picnic tables, a bathhouse housing an art studio, and a restroom at the south (Alki Point) end of the beach, where you'll find the monument to the arrival of the first white settlers on November 13, 1851. ",

In 1997, Sea Mar, a community organization located in South Park, was granted stewardship of the property by King County. In the years since Seattle Parks and Recreation assumed management of the park through a Surface Use Permit with King County. Students at nearby Concord school have participated in workshops learning about modern art and Cesar Chavez, and created a painting that is posted at the park.  Jesus Bautista Moroles, a nationally recognized stone sculptor, donated a sculpture titled \"Musical Steles,\" comprised of three musical basalt columns fabricated in the South Park neighborhood. A documentary titled \"Seasonal Soil...Singing Stones,\" made in 2003 by Jennifer Maas, tells the story of Cesar Chavez Park and South Park. The documentary has aired on the Seattle Channel and is shown as part of a permanent exhibit of Jesus Moroles' work at the Houston Museum of Art.",

During freeway construction in 1964, several more cannonballs were unearthed below Harborview Hospital.

    "About": "Denny Blaine Lake Park is a pocket park offers a small lake and a \"train station\" type shelter. This is one of five small parks in the area donated by the Denny-Blaine Land Company, a real estate development company. The parks are Minerva Fountain (commonly known as Denny-Blaine Lake Park), Stevens Park, Viretta Park, Children's Park (now Howell Park), and Whitman Place (now Denny-Blaine Park). The Denny-Blaine Land Company was operated by Elbert F. Blaine (1857-1942) and Charles L. Denny (1861-1919). Blaine was a member of the board of park commissioners from 1902 to 1908, an advocate of the Olmsted plan, and has been called \"the father of Seattle's Park System.\" Denny was a civic activist engaged in many business interests and a son of Seattle founder Arthur Armstrong Denny (1822-1899). The name Minerva Fountain is in honor of Minerva Stone Blaine (1861-1940), the wife of Elbert F. Blaine. The Denny-Blaine company built a shelter at Minerva Fountain for trolley riders, which also served as a realty office for the company. The name the park is now known by is derived from a sign on that structure stating the ultimate destination of many of the trolley riders, Denny-Blaine Park, which is on Lake Washington.",

Another part of the Seattle parks system named for Dr. Lavizzo is the children's water feature at nearby Edwin T. Pratt Park. The Dr. Blanch Lavizzo Water Play Area was built by the community in 1994-1995, using the Neighborhood Matching Fund to hire local African American artists. Designed with African motifs, the play area includes two water columns and three animal sculptures that spray water. On the site is a bronze plaque with an image of Dr. Lavizzo, text, and a poem by Alice Walker.",

    "About": "Matthews Beach is Seattle's largest freshwater bathing beach. The park is named for pioneer John G. Matthews, who had his homestead on the site in the 1880's. The park is an ideal stopping place for bicyclers on the Burke-Gilman Tail- in fact, the outline of the original cove is suggested by the Burke-Gilman Trail, which was once the tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad. In the 1940's, the area south of the main beach was the site of Pan American World Airways' offices, and the dock for Pan American's \"Clipper Ships\"- the world's first amphibious commercial air transports over the ocean. The City purchased the first ten acres of Matthews Beach in 1951. (Excerpted from Brandt Morgan's Enjoying Seattle's Parks.) 100' of sandbar shoreline north of where Thornton Creek meets Lake Washington allows for a hand carry boat launch. ",

Many of the remaining landscaping features suggest the park's history, such as stone walls, steps, small ponds, and exotic plants. The park includes many spectacular trees, including redwood, aspen, and dogwood. There is a birch grove and a wildflower meadow. Recent landscaping improvements emphasize low-maintenance and native plans. A new \"spring\" was created to honor the neighborhood's history of springs. Mineral Springs Park is home to one of Seattle's two disc golf courses. (The other is at Lakewood Park, SW 108th St. & 10th Ave. SW, in the King County Parks and Recreation system.) As a complement to that active game area and to the landscape, there is also an \"art walk.\" Artists Lynn Sullivan and Stacy Levy have created \"Cloud Stones\" especially for this park, a series of meditative stone sculptures intended to reflect the movement of clouds overhead. An information kiosk provides more details on the artworks as well as a map of the park.",

Featuring a 44-ft. wide cowboy hat and 22-ft. high boots, the Hat n' Boots opened the next year to a stampede of customers. In fact, for a time it was the biggest selling station in the state. Legend has it even Elvis dropped by when he was in town during the World's Fair in '62. But in the early 60's, a brand new interstate, I-5, started diverting traffic away from the station. By the late 80's it pretty much looked like trail's end for the Hat n' Boots. That's when some Georgetown residents saddled up to rescue the soul of their community. \"The Hat n' Boots is as important to Georgetown as the Golden Gate Bridge is to San Francisco,\" says Allan Phillips, former director of the Georgetown Community Council. \"If the Hat n' Boots were ever to be gone from Georgetown, it would be like losing our soul.\"",
